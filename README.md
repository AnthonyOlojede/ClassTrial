## Introduction
XYz LTD set a monthly sales target for 2023. I have computed the monthly sales figure from the original data source provided.

## Method of Analysis
I created a field for the calculated sales amount for each month from Jan to Dec. And extracted the monthly sales target from the company's 2023 sales forecast.
